The C MeatAxe originally started as a rewrite of FORTRAN programs by Charles
Parker and contains contributions by numerous people (see below). 

All code written by me (Michael Ringe) is dedicated to the public domain.

* The finite fields kernel (kernel-0.c) is originally based on hprout.c written
  by Klaus Lux.

* The homomorphisms programs (mkhom.c, decomp.c, rad.c, soc.c) were originally
  written by Magdolna Szőke.

* The tensor condensation programs were written by Markus Wiegelmann.
