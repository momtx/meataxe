@mainpage The C MeatAxe

The MeatAxe is a set of programs for working with matrices over
finite fields. Its primary purpose is the calculation of modular
character tables, although it can be used for other purposes, such
as investigating subgroup structure, module structure etc.
Indeed, there is a set of programs (see @ref pg_progs_lattice)
to compute automatically the submodule lattice of a given module.

Each of the programs is self-contained, reading its input from files,
and writing its output to files. To make the MeatAxe usable,
therefore, it is necessary to write operating system commands to run
the various programs. This documentation is primarily for the programs,
and further documentation is necessary for the various implementations
in differing operating environments.

The primitive objects are of two types: matrices and permutations.
Permutation objects can be handled, but not as smoothly as you might
expect. For example, it is hoped that programs such as split
(@ref prog_zsp "zsp") and multiply (@ref prog_zmu "zmu")
will be able to work with mixed types, but at present
ZSP is restricted to matrices only, and ZMU can multiply
a matrix by a permutation, but not vice versa.

<b>Remarks on the C implementation</b><br>
Most of the programs (including their documentation) in this package
are based on the FORTRAN code written by Richard A. Parker.
The translation from FORTRAN to C was done in 1989 and since then both
versions have developed independently.
The user interface of the C programs has been changed significantly
(e.g., command line arguments were introduced) and some new programs
have been added which are not available in the FORTRAN MeatAxe.

The objective of this suite of programs is research, so that where
simplicity and power are in contention, power is selected. Nevertheless,
I have tried to make the programs as straightforward and user-friendly
as possible. Moreover, the source code is freely available, so be free
to change any parts you are annoyed with.

<b>Supported platforms</b><br>
The MeatAxe should run on most UNIX platforms including Linux, NetBSD,
Ultrix, Solaris, HP-UX, and on Windows NT. Other platforms as MS-DOS,
VM/CMS and VMS are not officially supported, but it should not be too
difficult to compile and run the programs on those systems.

Users of the MeatAxe on a non-UNIX platform should be aware that their
operating system may impose some additional restrictions on the programs.
For example, the length and syntax of file names may be more restricted
as in UNIX, and CPU time information may not be available or incorrect.

/**
@page pg_progs_lattice The Lattice Programs

These programs are used to investigate the structure of matrix representations over
finite fields. The first step is always to find the irreducible constituents of the
representation with @ref prog_chop "chop", and to find the corresponding peak words with
@ref prog_pwkond "pwkond".
Here are some examples of what you can do with the programs:
- Calculate the complete submodule lattice of a module (using @ref prog_chop "chop", 
  @ref prog_pwkond "pwkond", @ref prog_mkcycl "mkcycl", @ref prog_mkinc "mkinc",
  @ref prog_mkdotl "mkdotl", @ref prog_mksub "mksub", @ref prog_genmod "genmod").
- Find out if a given irreducible module occurs as a constituent of a module
  (@ref prog_cfcomp).
- Draw the submodule lattice in graphical form (@ref prog_mkgraph "mkgraph").
- Calculate a module's socle and radical series (@ref prog_chop "chop",
  @ref prog_pwkond "pwkond",
  @ref prog_soc "soc", @ref prog_rad "rad").
- Calculate all homomorphisms between two modules, or the endomorphism
  ring of a module (@ref prog_chop "chop", @ref prog_pwkond "pwkond", MKHOM).
- Decompose a module into direct summands (@ref prog_chop "chop", @ref prog_pwkond "pwkond",
  @ref prog_mkhom "mkhom", @ref prog_decomp "decomp").

@section sec_progs_cond Condensation Programs
These programs are used to condense representations. @ref prog_zkd "zkd"
performs a fixed-point condensation of permutation representations.
It can be used after the orbits have been calculated with @ref prog_zmo "zmo".
@ref prog_zuk "zuk" uncondenses vectors.

@ref prog_precond "precond" and @ref prog_tcond "tcond" are used to
condense tensor products or matrix representations, when the restriction to
the condensation subgroup is semisimple.
The algorithm assumes that the irreducible constituents
of the restriction, and corresponding peak words are known, so you must
run @ref prog_chop "chop" and @ref prog_pwkond "pwkond" before.

/**
@page pg_start Installing the MeatAxe

This section contains some general information about the MeatAxe
programs and how to use them.

@section start_compile Compiling

Instructions for compiling and installing the MeatAxe can be found in the file
README.md, which is included in the distribution package.
There are several options which can be defined at compile time:

@par @c MTXBIN
Name of the MeatAxe binary directory. This should be the
final installation directory. The value selected at compile-time
can be overridden later by defining the environment variable
MTXBIN or by using the `-B' option.

@par @c MTXLIB
Name of the library directory, see @ref sec_libdir.
The value selected at compile-time can be overridden later by defining
the environment variable MTXLIB or by using the `-L' option.

@par @c DEBUG
Useful only for development and bug-fixing. Setting this option
results in more argument checking and, consequently, slower execution.

@par PARANOID
Even more argument checking. This option will cause problems with some
MeatAxe applications!

**/



/**
@page pg_using Using the MeatAxe Programs: General Remarks

@section sec_env Setting up the environment

It is recommended that you include the MeatAxe installation directory, where
all the programs are installed, in your path. You may also define the following
environment variables which are recognized by the MeatAxe programs:

@par @c MTXLIB
Name of the MeatAxe library directory, see @ref sec_libdir.
You need to define this variable only if you want to use a library directory
different from the default library directory chosen at compile time.
This can be overridden by the -L command line option.

@par @c MTXBIN
Name of the MeatAxe installation directory.
This is necessary if the programs have been moved into another directory without
recompiling and you want to use the automatic table file generation
feature.
The value of this variable can be overridden by the -B option.

@section sec_tables Arithmetic Tables
All programs use lookup tables for row operations and finite field arithmetic.
These tables are read from a file named <tt>pXXX.zzz</tt>.
where XXX is the field order.
For example, tables for GF(25) are read from the file <tt>p025.zzz</tt>.
If the table file does not exist, it will be created automatically.
You may also use the @ref prog_maketab "maketab" program
to generate the table file manually.
Table files may also be placed in the library directory (see below)
because the programs look there before they try to generate a new file.

@section sec_ft File Types
All MeatAxe programs operate on files and do not require user interaction.
There are two kinds of files:

- Binary (internal format) data files. Programs usually read
  and write data in binary format.

- Text files, used by some programs as @ref prog_zcv "zcv" and @ref prog_zpr "zpr".
  The format of text files is described with the @ref prog_zcv "zcv" program.

Typically, a program reads a number of input files and produces one or
more output files. For example, the ZMU (multiply) program expects two
input and one output file. Thus,
<pre>
zmu mat1 mat2 result
</pre>
reads matrices from "mat1" and "mat2", and writes the product to "result".
To find out which
files are used by a specific program, look up the program description in
section @ref pg_progs_index. You can also run any MeatAxe program
with the "--help" option to get an on-line help.

A detailed description of the MeatAxe file formats can be found in @ref pg_file_formats.


@section sec_libdir The library directory
When given a file name, all programs look for the file in the current
directory first. If the file is not found there, some programs try to
find it in the library directory, provided a library has been defined.
This extended search applies, for example, to ZEV and @ref prog_zcv "zcv" input files
and also to the arithmetic table files.

The library is usually defined at compile-time by defining MTXLIB.
This definition may be overridden at run-time by defining the environment variable MTXLIB.
In either case MTXLIB must be a directory name including
a trailing separator character (e.g., '/' for UNIX). When looking for
files in the library, the programs simply append the file name to the
value of MTXLIB in order to build the complete file name.
**/


/**
@page pg_programming Programmer's Guide
Since it was ported from FORTRAN to C in 1989 the MeatAxe has been freely available, including
source code, under the terms of the GNU general public license. Users are encouraged to extend
or modify the programs as needed.  Indeed, most of the recent improvements and additions to the
MeatAxe are the result of users' reports, requests, and experiments.

This documentation is intended to provide the information you need to write your own MeatAxe
programs or to modify existing ones. Since the software is changing continuously the documentation
is necessarily incomplete and not everywhere correct. So, even with this manual, you should be
prepared to look in the source code, which is always the ultimate reference.
Starting with release 2.3 I have tried to merge documentation and source code,
which should help to keep the documentation more up-to-date.

Internally, the MeatAxe is built in several layers where each layer uses
services provided by the lower layers.

\par Layer 1 - Kernel
The MeatAxe kernel provides the finite field arithmetic,
some low-level vector operations,
and a platform-independent interface to operating
system services, including the interaction with the user.
All kernel functions and global variables have names beginning with "Ff"
(finite field), "Mtx" (general functions), or "Sys" (OS interface).
Kernel functions generally do not allocate memory dynamically and do not
completetely check their arguments.
Most kernel services are simple,
but there are some more complex functions like Gaussian elimination,
which have been implemented in the kernel for performance reasons.


- @ref os
- @ref ff

\par Layer 2 - Objects
This layer encapsulates low-level functionality in "objects" 
like matrices, permutations, and polynomials. It also provides the
elementary operations with these objects like, for example, matrix
multiplication.
- @ref mat
- @ref poly
- @ref perm
- @ref bs
- @ref mf
- @ref mrep
- @ref imat
- @ref intset
- @ref matset

\par Layer 3 - Algorithms
This layer provides more complex operations which typically involve
several objects. The spin-up and split functions are examples for this
layer.
- @ref charpol
- @ref spinup
- @ref wgen

Throughout this documentation, layers 1 to 3 are referred to as the
"MeatAxe library". Indeed, these layers are implemented as a static library.

\par The program layer
The top layer includes the MeatAxe programs and shell scripts like
@ref prog_zad "zad", @ref prog_zmu "zmu", @ref prog_chop "chop", ...
See @ref pg_progs_index for detailed descriptions.

@section links Further Information
- @subpage pg_compiling



@page pg_compiling Compiling and Linking with the MeatAxe Library

To use the MeatAxe library in your programs you need two files:
\par libmtx.a
The library file. This file is generated during the compilation of the MeatAxe.
\par meataxe.h
The header file for all MeatAxe library functions.
This file is part of the distribution.


You must include the header file in your program by putting the line
@code
    #include "meataxe.h"
@endcode
somewhere at the top of your program.
If meataxe.h resides in the same directory as your program
the compiler will find it there.
Otherwise you must specify a complete path in the include statement
or specify the directory on the command line, for example:
<pre>
cc -c -I/usr/joe/mtx/src -o myprog.o myprog.c
</pre>
Having compiled your program you must link it with the
MeatAxe library. Here is an example:
<pre>
*msg{cc -o myprog myprog.o libmtx.a}
</pre>

**/


/**
@page prog_stdopts Standard Command Line Options
All MeatAxe programs expect one or more arguments, ususally the names
of input and output files. Arguments may be preceeded by program options
which always start with a minus sign. Options which don't need arguments
can be grouped together. For example, the two commands
<pre>
chop -G -V -V -V test
chop -GVVV test
</pre>
are equivalent. Some options require an additional argument which must be
separated from the option by a space. Here is an example:
<pre>
chop -g 3 -T 3600 -G -VV module
</pre>
Some options may have an alternative, long name starting with `--'.
These options cannot be grouped together with other options.

@section co Universal Options
The following command line options are understood by all MeatAxe programs:

@par --help
  Print a help message and exit.
@par -Q
  Quiet, no messages.
@par -V
  Verbose, more messages. Repeat this option (e.g., -VVV) to see more detailed information.
@par -T @em Time
  Limit CPU time to \e Time seconds.
@par -B @em BinDir
  Used to specify a different binary directory. This overrides both
  the directory name compiled into the programs and the value of
  MTXBIN.
@par -L @em LibDir
  Used to specify a different library directory. This overrides both
  the directory name compiled into the programs and the value of
  MTXLIB.
@par -o @em Options
  This option is used to set various options for testing and debugging
  the MeatAxe. Even if documented in the program descriptions, -o
  options may be changed or removed in the next release, so you should
  not rely on them.

@section oo Other Commonly Used Options
The following options are not supported by all programs, but their
meaning is always the same.

@par -g @em NGen
  Set the number of generators. This option must be followed
  by a positive integer.
@par -G
  Generate output in GAP format.
**/

/**
@page pg_file_formats File Formats

@section sec_fileformats_binary Binary Data Files

Binary data files contain a sequence of objects.
Each object consists of a 12 byte header, followed by the data part.
The object header consists of three 32-bit integers, T, R, and C,
which are are stored in little-endian format.
The first number, T, specifies which kind of object follows.
R and C carry additional information about the object.
Their exact meaning depends on the object type:
@verbatim
T   | Type of object   | R             |  C 
----|------------------|---------------|-----------------------
> 1 | Matrix over GF(T)| no. of rows   | no. of columns
-1  | Permutation      | no. of points | no. of permutations
-2  | Polynomial       | field         | degree
-3  | Bit string       | size          | 0
-8  | Integer matrix   | no. of rows   | no. of columns
@endverbatim

Note: most MeatAxe programs expect their input objects in separate files
rather than reading multiple objects from a single file. This is true,
for example, for the set of generators that is used by programs like
@ref prog_zsp or @ref prog_chop.
For this reason, most data files contain only a single object.


@subsection sec_fileformats_binary_mat Matrices
Matrices are stored as a sequence of rows in the internal format
(see @ref ff), but the rows are truncated to their actual length. 
For example, a row with 17 entries over GF(125) on a machine with
sizeof(long)=4 would occupy 20 bytes in memory but only 17 bytes in
a data file.
As specified in @ref UNDEFINED:kernel.ff, unused bits in the last byte
of each row are always filled with zeroes.

@subsection sec_fileformats_binary_perm Permutations
A permutation of degree N is stored as N 32-bit integers in little-endian
format, the i-th number being the image of i (for i = 0...N-1).

For example, the permutation (1 2)(3 4 5) on five points is represented
as (0 1)(2 3 4). The following hexdump shows the corresponding data file:
@verbatim
Offset  Content
0000000 ff ff ff ff     Header T = -1 (Permutation)
0000004 05 00 00 00     Header R = 5 (degree)
0000008 01 00 00 00     Header C = 1 (number of permutations)
000000c 01 00 00 00     p(0) = 1
0000010 00 00 00 00     p(1) = 0
0000014 03 00 00 00     p(2) = 3
0000018 04 00 00 00     p(3) = 4
000001c 02 00 00 00     p(4) = 2
@endverbatim

For compatibility with older MeatAxe versions, the program can also read
a different format where the points are numbered from 1 to N.

@subsection sec_fileformats_binary_poly Polynomials
A polynomial of degree n,
p(x)=a<sub>n</sub>x<sup>n</sup>+...+a<sub>1</sub>x+a<sub>0</sub>,
over GF(q) is stored with the header (-2,n,q). 
The header is followd by one row of size n+1 containing the coefficients
in ascendig order: (a<sub>0</sub>,a<sub>0</sub>,...a<sub>n</sub>).

@subsection sec_fileformats_binary_imat Integer matrices
An r-by-c matrix is stored with the header (-8,r,c), followed by the marks
in theit "natural" order, i.e., starting with a<sub>11</sub> and ending
with a<sub>rc<</sub>. The marks are stored in 32-bit little-endian format.

@subsection sec_fileformats_binary_bs Bit strings
A bit string of length n is stored with the header (-3,n,0), followed by
k 32-bit little-endian numbers, where k is chosen such that
32k ≤ n < 32k+1. The least significant bit of the first number is the
first bit of the string.
